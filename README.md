Udemy Unreal Course
This project is the very first, basic C++ lesson in the Udemy Course on Unreal 4 for game development. The issue I need solved is that when I debug this code, it performs, but also displays the PATH of the course
appears as:

Welcome to Bulls and Cows

E:\UdemyCourse\UnrealCourse\Section_02\Debug\BullCowGame.exe (process 7560) exited with code 0.
Press any key to close this window . . .

Need help eliminating the E:\ path from the output.
